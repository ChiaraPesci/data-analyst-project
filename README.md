# README #

*Data analyst project* created within the "Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program" at Udacity.  

In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.

The dataset under investigation contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), cleaned from the original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), including user ratings and revenue.  

### What is this repository for? ###

The topic of the creation of this webpage was to learn how to use css styles and classes within html files.

This project was to introduce the student to the data analysis process. In this project, one should also gain experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

### Who do I talk to? ###

People that needs an example of data analysis process.   
People interested in the actual outcome of the analysis about the movie database.
